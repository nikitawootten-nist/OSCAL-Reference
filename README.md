# OSCAL-Reference

This repository houses the infrastructure for the OSCAL model generation pipeline.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

```sh
git clone
cd OSCAL-Reference
git submodule update --init
```

2. Generate the site

```sh
make site
```

To see other common operations, refer to the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) or simply run `make help`.

### Local development

The target `make serve` runs builds the site and runs `hugo serve`.

### Link-checking

This repository uses [Lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/#/) to crawl the built site for bad external and internal links.
To perform link-checking, run the target `make linkcheck`.
The link checker produces a report, nominally located at `./lychee_report.md`.

Lychee is configured to ignore URL patterns present in the [`./support/lychee_ignore.txt`](./support/lychee_ignore.txt).

[Additional configuration](https://lychee.cli.rs/#/usage/cli) can be specified using the Makefile variable `LYCHEE_EXTRA_FLAGS`:

```sh
# Cache server responses to save bandwidth on repeated runs
make linkcheck LYCHEE_EXTRA_FLAGS='--cache'
```

### Speeding up the build

Some tasks such as generating the model documentation can be done in parallel for each target release.

Passing the `-j <number>` flag will allow for [parallel execution of makefile targets](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Parallel.html) and can significantly speed up build times.
Pass in an appropriate value (usually the core count of the current machine), e.x.:

```
make site -j 8
```
